# Is there a new wr?
Python script that checks speedrun.com for new WR in single game.
To use this script you have to:
- execute *createWRDatabase.py* to create initial database with WRs for list of games,
- execute *checkForNewWR.py* to compare existing WR database file with actual WRs on speedrun.com

In example I am using Grand Theft Auto series if you want to check WRs for another game/s you have to modify gamesList in both files.

# ToDo
- Modify script to get extended categories for games,
- Integration with Twitter API,
- Integration with Twitch API,
